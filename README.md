TurnFlow™ — Property Turnover Management System (Clean Edition)

Front-End Prototype | HTML • TailwindCSS • JavaScript

Executive Summary

TurnFlow™ is a streamlined prototype for a property turnover management platform designed to support property management operations, renovation tracking, and client reporting.
This Clean Edition focuses on presenting a structured, responsive user interface that outlines the core modules of a scalable turnover workflow system.

Purpose of the Prototype

This version was developed to:

Establish the foundational UI structure for future full-stack features

Demonstrate functional layout and module separation

Provide a clean blueprint for integrating workflow automation

Support future expansion into dashboards, task management, and cost estimation tools

The project serves as both a learning exercise and the initial phase for a larger, production-ready system.

Core Modules (Prototype Scope)
Project Management

Defines the area for creating, organizing, and tracking property turn or renovation tasks.

Cost Estimation

Allocates space for future logic related to labor, materials, contractor hours, and cost calculations.

Analytics Dashboard

Blueprint section for upcoming KPIs, performance metrics, and visual reporting.

Technology Stack

HTML5 — Page structure and semantic layout

TailwindCSS (CDN) — Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design

JavaScript — Base file prepared for future functionality

VS Code — Development environment
